# ExpressInHost_Web

In the rapidly evolving field of recombinant protein expression, ExpressInHost offers novel innovative solutions for codon optimisation. ExpressInHost tunes mRNA sequences to enhance their expression while considering the challenge of proper protein folding in a host organism. For thousands of different organisms, and customisable ones, leveraging tRNA gene copy number data, it analyses and compares translation speed properties in native and host organisms, possibly also incorporating evolutionary insights and optimising mRNA structural properties for ribosome binding.

ExpressInHost is a free, user-friendly, and fully open source web application that builds on our [previous work](https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jors.385) as well as on open source work from other groups for [tRNA data](https://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/) collection and [ribosome binding](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03362) properties.
